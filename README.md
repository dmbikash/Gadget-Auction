# ebay_app-with-flutter
I have made ebay type auction app with Flutter and Firebase.
This is apk link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vncoN8IOOpM07WrSk3n2wrO7gViqhfrm?usp=sharing .
I have completed Task 1,2,3,5 and 6
The challenges I haveve faced during making the project are:





        1.As  a new frame-work there are very few reading materials as well 
        as watching materials can be found, it was challenging to learn a new framework.
        The necessary information were taken from stack over flow, flutter official website
        (flutter.org) and YouTube.

        2.For a new flutter developer it was tough to find a package that suits the project
        from the vast number of packages. To use the packages, pictures, firebase
        in flutter one needs to make changes to the pubspec.yaml file where packages goes 
        under dependency protocol, pictures goes under asset protocol and firebase goes under
        build.graddle. 

        3.To figure out how every functions, widgets or commands works in the background, I had
        to made simple functions and demo codes every time which took a vast amount of time

        4.Fixing bugs for passing routing data was challenging.

        5.Connecting firebase with the project was one of the most challenging work. As, firebase
         updated their libraries, class and method names recently, many of the old commands did
         not work.
